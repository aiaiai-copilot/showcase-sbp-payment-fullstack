## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Materials

### For Frontend Developer (Lovable):
1. Study `frontend-backend-api.yaml` - this is your contract with Backend
2. Read `frontend-task.md` - complete technical specification
3. Use `PROJECT-README.md` for overall project understanding

### For Backend Developer (Claude Sonnet 4.5):
1. Study both specification files:
   - `frontend-backend-api.yaml` - contract with Frontend
   - `yookassa-webhook-api.yaml` - contract with YooKassa
2. Read `backend-task.md` - complete technical specification
3. Use `PROJECT-README.md` for overall project understanding

### For Project Manager:
1. `PROJECT-README.md` - general overview
2. Both tasks for understanding work scope
3. Specifications for technical review

## âœ¨ Approach Features

### API First
Contracts created first (OpenAPI), then tasks written based on them. This guarantees:
- Synchronization between Frontend and Backend
- Clear interface understanding
- Ability for parallel development
- Automatic compliance verification via contract testing

### Contract Testing
Both components must verify specification compliance using jest-openapi:
- Frontend verifies Backend responds according to contract
- Backend verifies it implements contract correctly
- Backend verifies it handles YooKassa webhooks properly

### Independent Development
Frontend and Backend can be developed in parallel:
- Common contract defined in OpenAPI
- Each component has its complete specification
- Monorepo with clear separation

### Test Mode
Entire project works in YooKassa test mode:
- Safe demonstration
- No real payments
- Full functionality for showcase

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Create monorepo:**
   ```bash
   mkdir yookassa-payment-demo
   cd yookassa-payment-demo
   mkdir frontend backend specs
   ```

2. **Place specifications:**
   ```bash
   cp frontend-backend-api.yaml specs/
   cp yookassa-webhook-api.yaml specs/
   ```

3. **Place general README:**
   ```bash
   cp PROJECT-README.md README.md
   ```

4. **Distribute tasks to developers:**
   - Lovable receives `frontend-task.md` + access to `specs/frontend-backend-api.yaml`
   - Sonnet 4.5 receives `backend-task.md` + access to both files in `specs/`

5. **Start parallel development:**
   - Frontend developer sets up project and implements UI
   - Backend developer sets up server and integrates YooKassa

6. **Contract testing at each stage:**
   - Regularly run tests to verify compliance
   - Early detection of contract mismatches
